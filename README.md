## Description

Just Tech News is a community-driver social news website that lets users create an account, post links to tech-related articles, comment on other users' articles, and upvote articles for points.

This application uses Python as the basis for a web server. It is a refactoring project that reconfigures the back end of the application, which was originally built using Node.js, to use Python.

The purpose of refactoring this application is to learn Python, and in completing this, I have learned how to:

* Build and deploy to the cloud a Flask API with correct project structure and necessary dependencies.

* Connect the application to an Relational Database Management Software (RDBMS) database using SQL Alchemy to support the API model.

* Create a REST API that performs CRUD operations.

* Set up and configure a local virtual environment for Python Flask.

* Explain the differences between JavaScript and Python.

* Add templating to the application to allow for user interactions.

* Perform basic DevOps and deploy to a cloud infrastructure.

## Technologies Used

TODO: ADD LINKS TO TECHNOLOGIES

The Just Tech News application uses the following tools and technologies:

* **Flask** Python library is used to set up a web server and define "GET", "POST", "PUT", and "DELETE" routes.
  
  * Flask's built-in **Global Session Objects** is used to keep users logged in, protect certain API routes, and provide other user authentication methods.

* **Jinga2** Python web template engine is used to render HTML pages by combining the Jinga2 templates with the Flask routes.

* **SQLAlchemy** Python library is used to connect to a relational database and define the MySQL database models.

* **PyMySQL**

* **Bcrypt** library is used to further protect the data and application by providing password encryption.

* **Cryptography**

* **Python DotEnv**

* **Python's `assert`, `try`, `accept` Statements** are used to handle errors.

* **Heroku** is used to make the application production-read and deploy the social news website to the cloud.
